# Verve_Task

Hi my future coleagues,

first of all pull the project and open it in intellij IDE 
after that build it with sbt or sbt compile.
to have the result of first and second challenge
first change addresses compatible to your system
and then...
run main method!

results.txt is the result format as you expected!

hope to have right answers regarding to 6h time to do this task!


and finally for the third challenge it's required to comment line 14 if you use linux or change the address of this winutills property compatible to your filesystem!

the you can run this method(task3) and enjoy the result :)
